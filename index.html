                <p><em>MA in English Literature</em>
                <br><em>Aspiring Web Developer & Graphic Designer</em></p>
                <p>After graduating summa cum laude from Lipscomb University in Nashville, TN with a Bachelor's of Arts degree in English Writing, I flew to northern France to work as an English language assistant through <a href="https://frenchhighereducation.org/teaching-assistant-program">TAPIF (Teaching Assistant Program in France)</a>. I returned to the United States to complete a Master's in English Literature, which gave me the opportunity to teach as a First-Year-Composition instructor for two semesters. Now I am shifting gears from teaching. I have recently decided to pursue a career in either graphic design or web development (or both!). This website is my very first. Voilà! Welcome to my learning process!</p></td>
